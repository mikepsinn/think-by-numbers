<em><strong>The Wisdom of Crowds </strong></em>is about the aggregation of information in groups, resulting in decisions that are often better than could have been made by any single member of the group.

The opening anecdote relates <a title="Francis Galton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_Galton">Francis Galton</a>'s surprise that the crowd at a county fair accurately guessed the weight of an <a title="Ox" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox">ox</a> when their individual guesses were averaged (the average was closer to the ox's true butchered weight than the estimates of most crowd members, and also closer than any of the separate estimates made by cattle experts).

The book relates to diverse collections of independently deciding individuals, rather than <a title="Crowd psychology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowd_psychology">crowd psychology</a> as traditionally understood. Its central thesis, that a diverse collection of independently deciding individuals is likely to make certain types of decisions and predictions better than individuals or even experts.

<h2>Types of crowd wisdom</h2>

Surowiecki breaks down the advantages he sees in disorganized decisions into three main types, which he classifies as

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cognition</strong></li>
</ul>

<dl><dd>Thinking and information Processing</dd><dd><a title="Market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market">Market</a> judgment, which he argues can be <em>much</em> faster, more reliable, and less subject to political forces than the deliberations of experts or expert committees.</dd></dl>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Coordination</strong></li>
</ul>

<dl><dd>Coordination of behavior includes optimizing the utilization of a popular bar and not colliding in moving traffic flows. The book is replete with examples from <a title="Experimental economics" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_economics">experimental economics</a>, but this section relies more on <a title="Natural experiment" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment">naturally occurring experiments</a> such as pedestrians optimizing the <a title="Sidewalk" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sidewalk">pavement</a> flow or the extent of crowding in popular restaurants. He examines how <em>common understanding</em> within a culture allows remarkably accurate judgments about specific reactions of other members of the <a title="Culture" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture">culture</a>.</dd></dl>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Cooperation</strong></li>
</ul>

<dl><dd>How groups of people can form networks of <a title="Trust (sociology)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trust_(sociology)">trust</a> without a central system controlling their behavior or directly enforcing their compliance. This section is especially pro <a title="Free market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_market">free market</a>.</dd></dl>

<h2>Four elements required to form a wise crowd</h2>

Not all crowds (groups) are wise. Consider, for example, mobs or crazed investors in a <a title="Stock market bubble" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble">stock market bubble</a>. According to Surowiecki, these key criteria separate wise crowds from irrational ones:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<th>Criteria</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Diversity of <a title="Opinion" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion">opinion</a></td>
<td>Each person should have private information even if it's just an eccentric interpretation of the known facts.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Independence</td>
<td>People's opinions aren't determined by the opinions of those around them.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Decentralization</td>
<td>People are able to specialize and draw on local knowledge.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Aggregation</td>
<td>Some mechanism exists for turning private judgments into a collective <a title="Decision making" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making">decision</a>.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Based on Surowiecki’s book, Oinas-Kukkonen<sup id="cite_ref-3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup> captures the wisdom of crowds approach with the following eight conjectures:

<ol>
    <li>It is possible to describe how people in a group think as a whole.</li>
    <li>In some cases, groups are remarkably intelligent and are often smarter than the smartest people in them.</li>
    <li>The three conditions for a group to be intelligent are diversity, independence, and decentralization.</li>
    <li>The best decisions are a product of disagreement and contest.</li>
    <li>Too much communication can make the group as a whole less intelligent.</li>
    <li>Information aggregation functionality is needed.</li>
    <li>The right information needs to be delivered to the right people in the right place, at the right time, and in the right way.</li>
    <li>There is no need to chase the expert.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Failures of crowd intelligence</h2>

Surowiecki studies situations (such as <a title="Stock market bubble" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_market_bubble">rational bubbles</a>) in which the crowd produces very bad judgment, and argues that in these types of situations their cognition or cooperation failed because (in one way or another) the members of the crowd were too conscious of the opinions of others and began to emulate each other and conform rather than think differently. Although he gives experimental details of crowds collectively swayed by a persuasive speaker, he says that the main reason that groups of people intellectually conform is that the system for making decisions has a systematic flaw.

Surowiecki asserts that what happens when the <a title="Decision making" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_making">decision making</a> environment is not set up to accept the crowd, is that the benefits of individual judgments and private <a title="Information" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a> are lost and that the crowd can only do as well as its smartest member, rather than perform better (as he shows is otherwise possible).<sup id="cite_ref-WOC-R-01_4-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-WOC-R-01-4">[4]</a></sup> Detailed case histories of such failures include:

<table>

<th>Extreme</th>
<th>Description</th>

<tr>
<td>Homogeneity</td>
<td>Surowiecki stresses the need for diversity within a crowd to ensure enough variance in approach, thought process, and private information.</td>

<tr>
<td>Centralization</td>
<td>The <a title="Space Shuttle Columbia disaster" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia shuttle disaster</a>, which he blames on a hierarchical <a title="NASA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NASA">NASA</a> management bureaucracy that was totally closed to the wisdom of low-level engineers.</td>

<tr>
<td>Division</td>
<td>The <a title="United States Intelligence Community" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Intelligence_Community">United States Intelligence Community</a>, the 9/11 Commission Report claims, failed to prevent the <a title="11 September 2001 attacks" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11_September_2001_attacks">11 September 2001 attacks</a> partly because information held by one subdivision was not accessible by another. Surowiecki's argument is that crowds (of <a title="Intelligence (information gathering)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_(information_gathering)">intelligence</a> <a title="Intelligence analysis" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_analysis">analysts</a>in this case) work best when they choose for themselves what to work on and what information they need. (He cites the <a title="SARS" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS">SARS</a>-virus isolation as an example in which the free flow of data enabled laboratories around the world to coordinate research without a central point of control.)The <a title="Office of the Director of National Intelligence" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_the_Director_of_National_Intelligence">Office of the Director of National Intelligence</a> and the <a title="CIA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIA">CIA</a> have created a <a title="Wikipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>-style information sharing network called <a title="Intellipedia" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellipedia">Intellipedia</a>that will help the free flow of information to prevent such failures again.</td>

This can lead to fragile social outcomes.</td>

<h2>Connection</h2>

Surowiecki presented a session entitled <em>Independent Individuals and Wise Crowds, or Is It Possible to Be Too Connected?</em><sup id="cite_ref-6"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>

<blockquote>
<div>The question for all of us is, how can you have interaction without information cascades, without losing the independence that’s such a key factor in group intelligence?</div></blockquote>

He recommends:

<ul>
    <li>Keep your ties loose.</li>
    <li>Keep yourself exposed to as many diverse sources of information as possible.</li>
    <li>Make groups that range across hierarchies.</li>
</ul>

Tim O’Reilly<sup id="cite_ref-7"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> and others also discuss the success of <a title="Google" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google">Google</a>, <a title="Wiki" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">wikis</a>, <a title="Blog" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog">blogging</a>, and <a title="Web 2.0" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">Web 2.0</a> in the context of the wisdom of crowds.

<h2>Applications</h2>

Surowiecki is a very strong advocate of the benefits of decision markets and regrets the failure of <a title="DARPA" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DARPA">DARPA</a>'s controversial <a title="Policy Analysis Market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_Analysis_Market">Policy Analysis Market</a> to get off the ground. He points to the success of public and internal corporate markets as evidence that a collection of people with varying points of view but the same motivation (to make a good guess) can produce an accurate aggregate prediction. According to Surowiecki, the aggregate predictions have been shown to be more reliable than the output of any <a title="Think tank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_tank">think tank</a>. He advocates extensions of the existing futures markets even into areas such as <a title="Terrorism" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrorism">terrorist</a> activity and prediction markets within companies.

To illustrate this thesis, he says that his publisher is able to publish a more compelling output by relying on individual authors under one-off contracts bringing book ideas to them. In this way they are able to tap into the wisdom of a much larger crowd than would be possible with an in-house writing team.

<a title="Will Hutton" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Hutton">Will Hutton</a> has argued that Surowiecki's analysis applies to value judgments as well as factual issues, with crowd decisions that "emerge of our own aggregated free will [being] astonishingly... decent". He concludes that "There's no better case for pluralism, diversity and democracy, along with a genuinely independent press."<sup id="cite_ref-8"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup>

Applications of the wisdom-of-crowds effect exist in three general categories: <a title="Prediction market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">Prediction markets</a>, <a title="Delphi method" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method">Delphi methods</a>, and extensions of the <a title="Psephology" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psephology">traditional opinion poll</a>.

<h3>Prediction markets</h3>

<div>Main article: <a title="Prediction market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">Prediction market</a></div>

The most common application is the prediction market, a speculative or betting market created to make verifiable predictions. Surowiecki discusses the success of <a title="Prediction market" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market">prediction markets</a>. Similar to <a title="Delphi method" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method">Delphi methods</a> but unlike <a title="Opinion poll" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_poll">opinion polls</a>, prediction (information) markets ask questions like, “Who do you think will win the election?” and predict outcomes rather well. Answers to the question, "Who will you vote for?" are not as predictive.

Assets are cash values tied to specific outcomes (e.g., Candidate X will win the election) or parameters (e.g., Next quarter's revenue). The current market prices are interpreted as predictions of the probability of the event or the expected value of the parameter. <a title="Betfair" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betfair">Betfair</a> is the world's biggest prediction exchange, with around $28 billion traded in 2007. <a title="NewsFutures" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NewsFutures">NewsFutures</a> is an international prediction market that generates consensus probabilities for news events. Several companies now offer enterprise class prediction marketplaces to predict project completion dates, sales, or the market potential for new ideas.<sup>[<em><a title="Wikipedia:Citation needed" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed">citation needed</a></em>]</sup> A number of Web-based quasi-prediction marketplace companies have sprung up to offer predictions primarily on sporting events and stock markets but also on other topics. Those companies include <a title="Piqqem" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piqqem">Piqqem</a>, <a title="Cake Financial" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cake_Financial">Cake Financial</a>, <a title="Covestor" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covestor">Covestor</a>, <a title="Predictify" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictify">Predictify</a>, and the <a title="Motley Fool" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motley_Fool">Motley Fool</a> (with its Fool CAPS product). The principle of the prediction market is also used in <a title="Project management software" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_management_software">project management software</a> such as Yanomo to let team members predict a project's "real" deadline and budget.

<h3>Delphi methods</h3>

<div>Main article: <a title="Delphi method" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method">Delphi method</a></div>

The Delphi method is a systematic, interactive <a title="Forecasting" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forecasting">forecasting</a> method which relies on a panel of independent experts. The carefully selected experts answer questionnaires in two or more rounds. After each round, a facilitator provides an anonymous summary of the experts’ forecasts from the previous round as well as the reasons they provided for their judgments. Thus, participants are encouraged to revise their earlier answers in light of the replies of other members of the group. It is believed that during this process the range of the answers will decrease and the group will converge towards the "correct" answer. Many of the consensus forecasts have proven to be more accurate than forecasts made by individuals.

<h2>In popular culture</h2>

The <a title="Hugo Award for Best Novel" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugo_Award_for_Best_Novel">Hugo-winning</a> 1968 <a title="Science fiction" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_fiction">science fiction</a> novel <em><a title="Stand on Zanzibar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand_on_Zanzibar">Stand on Zanzibar</a></em> by <a title="John Brunner (novelist)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Brunner_(novelist)">John Brunner</a> includes an elaborate planet-wide information futures and betting pool called "Delphi" based on the Delphi method.

Illusionist <a title="Derren Brown" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Derren_Brown">Derren Brown</a> claimed to use the 'Wisdom of Crowds' concept to explain how he correctly predicted the UK National Lottery results in September 2009. His explanation was met with criticism on-line, by people who argued that the concept was misapplied.<sup id="cite_ref-9"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-9">[9]</a></sup> The Wisdom of Crowds concept by definition requires a known truth or absolute in order to work; the lottery has no such previously existent absolute outcome. The methodology employed was too, flawed; the sample of people, couldn’t have been totally objective and free in thought, because they were gathered multiple times and socialised with each other too much; a condition Surowiecki tells us is corrosive to pure independence and the diversity of mind required (Surowiecki 2004:38). Groups thus fall into <a title="Groupthink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink">groupthink</a> where they increasingly make decisions based on influence of each other and are thus <em>less</em> accurate. However, other commentators have suggested that, given the entertainment nature of the show, Brown's misapplication of the theory may have been a deliberate smokescreen to conceal his true method.<sup id="cite_ref-bbctrick_10-0"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-bbctrick-10">[10]</a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-11"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wisdom_of_Crowds#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>

This was also shown in the television series East of Eden where a social network of roughly 10,000 individuals came up with ideas to stop missiles in a very short span of time.
