<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;"><a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending">15%</a> of likely U.S. voters think the federal government should continue to provide <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0745642411/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0745642411&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">funding for foreign countries</a> to buy military weapons from U.S. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="line-height: normal;">companies. Seventy percent (<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending">70%</a>) oppose this funding to promote U.S. arms sales. Fifteen percent (<a href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/august_2011/voters_see_these_corporate_welfare_programs_as_a_good_place_to_cut_government_spending">15%</a>) are undecided about it.  (To see survey question wording, <a style="color: #3e72ae;" href="http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/questions/pt_survey_questions/august_2011/questions_corporate_welfare_august_11_12_2011" target="_self">click here</a>.)</span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Voters are more closely divided on the topic of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005ZH34ZQ/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B005ZH34ZQ&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">farm subsidies</a>. The U.S. government typically provides more than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agricultural_subsidy">$20 billion</a> a year in crop and farm subsidies, and 37% of voters feel those subsidies should continue. But a plurality (46%) thinks those subsidies should be ended, while 17% more are not sure.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; padding-top: 5px; padding-bottom: 5px;">Similarly, the federal government’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0521104661/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0521104661&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=quant08-20" target="_blank">Export-Import bank</a> provides billions of dollars in loans and loan guarantees to companies like Boeing and General Electric. The stated purpose is to sustain American jobs by financing U.S. exports.  But just <a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/search-results?cx=006606822365722333854%3Afgcvw6tf0fw&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;query=voters%20don%20t%20support%20corporate%20welfare&amp;sa=Search">29%</a> of voters believe the government should continue to provide loans and loan guarantees to help finance export sales for large corporations. Again, a plurality of 46% opposes loans and loan guarantees for this purpose. Twenty-five percent (<a href="https://www.downsizinggovernment.org/search-results?cx=006606822365722333854%3Afgcvw6tf0fw&amp;cof=FORID%3A10&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;query=voters%20don%20t%20support%20corporate%20welfare&amp;sa=Search">25%</a>) are undecided.</p>
